# dotfiles

My personal configuration files. Haven't gotten around to making an install script,
so enjoy a txt file with the locations to symlink :)


## Symbolic links
To make a link, use the 'ln -s' command. Usage: `ln -s [local file] [symlink location]`

| Local file name      | Symlink location |
| -------------------- | ----------------
| vimrc                | ~/.vimrc
| zshrc                | ~/.zshrc
| vim/*                | ~/.vim/
| oh-my-zsh/alias.zsh  | ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/
| oh-my-zsh/themes/    | ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/
| gitconfig            | ~/.gitconfig
| sublime-text/*       | ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
