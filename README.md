# dotfiles

My personal configuration files. Somehow they work together to make my life easier.
As I only use macOS as my primary platform, these have not been tested to work on any other *nix platforms.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maybeinit/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
(cd ~/dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh)
```
