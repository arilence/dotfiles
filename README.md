# dotfiles

My personal configuration files. Somehow they work together to make my life easier.

### Installation
- Clone repo to your $HOME
- Run the install script`./install.sh`

### Notes
- At the moment, these files are OS X specific. One day I will make them work on *nix platforms.
- Please change the user details inside of the file `git/gitconfig` before using.
